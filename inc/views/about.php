			<h2>Movie Collection Manager (MCM)</h2>
				<p>With DVDs being so small, the novelty of owning a movie, and the ever growing number of movies today, many people have huge movie collections to showcase.  Perhaps one of these movie collectors would like to entertain a guest of theirs with a movie?  However, their movie collection size could be overwhelming for their guest to decide on a movie.  The purpose of this project is to help make movie collection browsing easier along with these features:<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Allowing the host to narrow down the choices of movies for the guest to choose from by "have not seen," "seen but I wouldn't mind watching again," or other filters of their choosing.</li>
					<li>Easily moving a movie from a "have not seen" to a "have seen" list.</li>
					<li>When clicking on a movie in the collection, being shown a movie summary and trailer(s) with ease.</li>
					<li>Being able to access 100% of the website's features from any device with an HTML5 browser!</li>
					<li>With more features in the works!</li>
				</ul>
