			<h2>Movie Collection Manager (MCM)</h2>
			<p>With DVDs being so small, the novelty of owning a movie, and the ever growing number of movies today, many people have huge movie collections to showcase.  Perhaps one of these movie collectors would like to entertain a guest of theirs with a movie?  However, their movie collection size could be overwhelming for their guest to decide on a movie.  The purpose of this project is to help make movie collection browsing easier  with these features:<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Easily add and delete movie lists from your collection!</li>
				<li>Easily add and delete movies from your lists!</li>
				<li>Easily moving a movie from separate lists!</li>
				<li>Clicking a movie within a list shows the trailer(s) along with additional information!</li>
				<li>Being able to access 100% of the website's features from any device with an HTML5 browser!</li>
				<li>Easily share your lists of movies to anyone by a click of a button!</li>
