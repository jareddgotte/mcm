## About

With DVDs being so small, the novelty of owning a movie, and the ever growing number of movies today, many people have huge movie collections to showcase. Perhaps one of these movie collectors would like to entertain a guest of theirs with a movie? However, their movie collection size could be overwhelming for their guest to decide on a movie. The purpose of this project is to help make movie collection browsing easier with these features:

- Easily add and delete movie lists from your collection!
- Easily add and delete movies from your lists!
- Easily moving a movie from separate lists!
- Clicking a movie within a list shows the trailer(s) along with additional information!
- Being able to access 100% of the website's features from any device with an HTML5 browser!
- Easily share your lists of movies to anyone by a click of a button!
- More features are in the works!
